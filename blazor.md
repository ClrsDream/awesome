* 2018/Oct - Ignite.  0.6.0 release.  .NET Core 3.0 for server side availability announced.  Via Daniel Roth <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2018/10/02/blazor-0-6-0-experimental-release-now-available/> "We announced last month at .NET Conf that we've decided to move forward with shipping the Blazor server-side model as part of ASP.NET Core in .NET Core 3.0."
* 2018/Sept - At .NET Conf Keynote (2018/Sept) server side blazor will be included in .NET Core 3.0.  Client site will remain experimental until WebAssembly tech is more mature.
* 2018/July - Please note that Blazor is still an experimental project, not supported product, so it should not be used for production workloads. The purpose of this experimental phase is to work out the technical details of running .NET in the browser and to gauge developer interest. We hope youâ€™ll give it a try! If you run into issues or have questions while trying out Blazor please file issues on GitHub. You can also chat with us and the Blazor community on Gitter if you get stuck or to share how Blazor is working for you.
